# Progetto Document and Data Mining
Document and Data Mining project. Object detection on flowchart diagrams using Faster R-CNN.

Faster R-CNN has to classify and retrieve elements that belongs to an image of a flowchart diagram.

Keras implementation of Faster R-CNN was cloned from https://github.com/RockyXu66/Faster_RCNN_for_Open_Images_Dataset_Keras.

I've been experimenting with various data augmentation techniques using the library [imgaug](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).

Augm folder contains python files developed by me, that are part of the project [Flowcharts](https://github.com/PaulaMihalcea/Flowcharts).
